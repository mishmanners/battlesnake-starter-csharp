# [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com) C# Starter

This is a basic implementation of the Battlesnake API. It's a great starting point for anyone wanting to program their first Battlesnake using C#. 
It can also be deployed to Azure, or any other cloud provider you'd like.

Forked from the official Battlesnake starter. There are lots of snakes you can use to get started, including Python, Go, C#, and more. If you are forking the repo, add "Battlesnake" to the tags and you'll appear on the [official Battlesnake tag](https://twitter.com/playbattlesnake/status/1470159791762796550). As of Dec 2021, there are over 1000 Battlesnake repos! ðŸ˜²
